  <h1 class="hero"><span class="layout">Online platforms & standards</span></h1>

  <div class="layout">
    <p>An <dfn>online platform</dfn> is a set of shared components, tools, functions, services and documentation available for use across the organisation.<p>

    <h2>Our principles</h2>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>
        <h3>Prioritise our users over everything else</h3>
        <p>Some of the most vulnerable people in the UK use Barnardo's websites, often in stressful situations. Do not sacrifice simplicity in their experience for the sake of our own convenience.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Provide the broadest access</h3>
        <p>An internet connection should be enough to access Barnardo's online. Do not exclude people based on ability, technology, network quality, geographical location, or personal circumstances.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Consider user journeys from start to finish</h3>
        <p>User experience is how people feel about the prospect of using a product, how they feel while using it, and how they feel about it when they've finished. Design for the whole journey.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Always test with real users</h3>
        <p>User interface design is where intuition goes to die. Validate ideas with real users and Barnardo's subject matter experts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Iterate to improve</h3>
        <p>Good online platforms are an aggregation of marginal gains, over time. What worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. Experimenting, prototyping, and refining are creative endeavours.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Make our brand shine through</h3>
        <p>Our brand is a powerful tool in our ambition to deliver on our ten-year strategy. It allows us to reach more of those who need us and want to support us, and reinforces trust in us.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Work in the open</h3>
        <p>Educate, collaborate, share, and learn with external communities for the betterment of society. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
