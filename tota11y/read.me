for now, this is manually copied from https://github.com/babylonhealth/Tota11y/tree/main/dist

(Bruce rescued it from potential oblivion after bankruptcy of Babylon Health)

There should probably be some automated way whereby that directory is checked once a day for a new version, and that be copied automatically.

Bruce's instructions are archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20230106155321/https://tota11y.babylontech.co.uk/ but they are probably copyright.
