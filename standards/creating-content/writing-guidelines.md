## Introduction – how to use this guide

<b>These guidelines are foreveryone working for and with Barnardo’s, to assist in the creation and production of clear, effective and consistent publications and promotional materials.</b>

The approaches we have adopted are designed to support our brand identity and to convey to internal and external audiences that we are an effective, authoritative and accessible organisation.

We are aware that individual styles vary, but hope that these guidelines will make it easier to ensure that Barnardo’s materials continue to present a consistent image.

## Our breadth of work

<b>The breadth of work we do is hugely impressive and is something we want to be known for. But to create better outcomes for more children, we need to be strategically focused.</b>

We’re committing to three strategic aims that will help us do just that. We will work with children, young people and their families/carers to help build:

- Stronger families
- Safer childhoods
- Positive futures

To find out which services sit under each strategic pillar, see [our corporate strategy](https://www.barnardos.org.uk/who-we-are/our-strategy).

To help explain to the public what we do we have highlighted six priority areas of our work within the strategic pillars. This is how we express the services which sit under each strategic pillar.

When using an image of a child you can use the short form version e.g. Nurture Me.

### Stronger families

Early support – Help us nurture struggling young families.

<b>Nurture Me</b>

Family support – Help us support disadvantaged families.

<b>Support Me</b>

Emotional health and wellbeing – Help us counsel and guide frightened children.

<b>Counsel Me</b>

### Safer childhoods

Child sexual exploitation and abuse – Help us protect sexually exploited and abused children.

<b>Protect Me</b>

Looked after children – Help us find new families to welcome defenceless children.

<b>Welcome Me</b>

### Positive futures

Care leavers – Help us empower vulnerable children leaving care.

<b>Empower Me</b>

## Our tone of voice

<b>Every child needs someone to believe in them and our voice should support this. It should inspire the public to believe in children and the children to believe in themselves.</b>

We do this by speaking in a manner which is **courageous, hopeful, and most importantly – authentic**.

We write in down-to-earth, everyday English. We do not use unnecessary adjectives or metaphors or sensationalise like a tabloid newspaper. But we don’t shy away from the facts.

### Our voice should be

- thought provoking
- hard-hitting
- emotionally charged
- uplifting
- optimistic
- authentic
- approachable
- supportive

### Our voice shouldn’t be

- preachy
- controversial for controversy’s sake
- sentimental
- naively positive
- metaphorical
- self-congratulatory

### How we should speak

Barnardo’s transforms children’s lives every day. Everything you donate will help a child have a second chance. Everything you buy will help fund our work with the UK’s most vulnerable children. This week we are looking for pre-loved winter coats in good condition.

### How we shouldn’t speak

Please, please give whatever you can to help abused, desperate children. We’ll take anything you can spare. Your old coat is the difference between a child getting a meal or going hungry. Please help us do more for helpless children.

## How we tell a story

<b>Whenever telling a story, we always try to demonstrate the full transformation from trauma to a brighter future. The child should be the hero of every story and Barnardo’s should play a supporting role, helping the child reach their full potential.</b>

### Do

- show the transformation from trauma to hope
- be knowledgeable
- be positive
- use the child’s own words
- be uplifting
- inspire and amaze
- show resilience and defiance
- be understanding
- leave room for theaudience’s imagination

### Don’t

- be too graphic
- focus solely on the past
- elaborate or inventstories
- be insensitive
- be judgemental
- use anger oraggression
- be cold
- sensationalise
- be overly emotional

### We sound like

"Ayesha was unaware of the dangers online. She didn’t realise that she was being ‘groomed’ for sexual exploitation. With Barnardo’s help, she’s come to realise that she is not to blame for the terrible things that happened to her."

### We don’t sound like

"Ayesha shouldn’t have been talking to a stranger online. When she arrived at his house, every parent’s nightmare came true. She became part of his sick, perverted game. Barnardo’s have helped make everything normal again for Ayesha. She’s come out of her shell and blossomed. Thanks to Barnardo’s she’s able to spread her wings and fly."

## Barnardo’s house style

When writing materials for or about Barnardo’s, general points to consider include:

**Aim for a straightforward, simple style**. Ensure your writing is clear and concise. Focus on using one main idea in a sentence and keep your sentence length down to maximum15 or 20 words.

**Avoid using jargon and unexplained acronyms**. Use everyday English where possible. Don’t use unnecessary long words; note that the average reading age of the UK population is 9 years.

**Avoid official or formal-sounding words when there’s a plain-English way or saying it** for example:

- access = get
- address = deal with
- deliver better outcomes = improve lives
- prior to = before

**Consider your readers and try to ensure that your language and levels of explanation are appropriate for them**. You could try to imagine you are talking to your reader, as that will help you find the right tone of voice.

**Be authentic and optimistic**. We know the positive impact of our work and the difference we make to the lives of children, young people and their families.

**Keep in mind that our work empowers children and young people, providing solutions which transform their lives**. Avoid comments or sentiments like ‘The work of Barnardo’s saves children’s lives’ and never refer to the children and young people we work with as ‘helpless’.

**Use active verbs**. Say ‘we will do it’ rather than ‘it will be done by us’.

**Personalise your message as much as is appropriate**. Use ‘you’ and ‘we’; when talking about Barnardo’s or a specific service. It helps define the nature of the reader’s relationship with Barnardo’s. Write ‘you can get advice from...’ rather than ‘advice is available from...’ ‘We’ is a good inclusive term that can refer to Barnardo’s, its supporters and service users. ‘We/you’ also helps avoid the passive and makes sentences simpler and clearer.

**Focus on our work today, not our past**. We are proud of our pioneering past – but we’re more concerned with the present. Keep the focus of your writing on our current work and the difference we’re making today.

**Always be non-judgemental**. We believe in children no matter who they are, what they have done or what they have been through. We treat everyone fairly and equally.

**Choose your tense – past, present or future – carefully and use it logically and consistently**. Are you describing events that are in the past, happening currently or planned in the future? If you choose the present tense for events that are in progress, will they still be in progress when your readers receive the information?

**Don’t forget to use your spell-check!** Make use of the spelling and grammar checkers on your computer, but bear in mind that these have limitations, and that we have our own house style and preferred spellings.

**Remember we do everything we do because we believe in children and we know that when you believe in children they start to believe in themselves**. Please ensure our key messaging which can be found in the brand guidelines is at the heart of any communication material.

## Writing about Barnardo’s

<b>Some particular rules and styles apply when talking about the organisation.</b>

- Barnardo’s is always spelt with an apostrophe.
- Barnardo’s is a singular entity, e.g. ‘Barnardo’s is launching a new campaign’, not ‘Barnardo’s are launching a new campaign’.
- Barnardo’s has no apostrophe after the ‘s’ where it is used possessively, e.g. use ‘Barnardo’s property’, not ‘Barnardo’s’ property’ or even ‘Barnardo’s’s property’. • The words ‘services’, ‘projects’ and ‘schemes’ should be lower case, e.g. ‘the service offers counselling to children, unless it is actually part of the title, e.g. the Amazon Young Person’s Counselling Service.
- When talking about our work, you should generally talk about our services rather than our projects, e.g. We run services across the UK. However, if you are communicating to a general external audience with no specific knowledge of childcare services, especially on fundraising materials, it is acceptable to use the term projects.
- Nations should appear as Barnardo’s Scotland, Barnardo’s Cymru, Barnardo’s Northern Ireland or simply as Northern Ireland where the context is clear.
- When Barnardo’s retail and fundraising offices are located separately from children’s services, use ‘Barnardo’s Yorkshire fundraising office’, ‘Midlands retail office’, etc.
- Children’s services and marketing are directorates. Groups within the department are known as teams, e.g. creative team.

## Punctuation and grammar

### Acronyms and abbreviations
Spell out acronyms and abbreviations the first time they are used in a chapter or section, followed by the letters in brackets. Use the acronym only after that.

Do not use full points in abbreviations or spaces between initials, e.g. US, mph, 4am, apart from e.g., i.e. and nos.

### Apostrophes
- its (possessive) is different from it’s (an abbreviation of ‘it is’) e.g. Barnardo’s cares for its staff; it’s time to volunteer. If you are unsure which to use, consider whether your use of ‘it’s’ can be replaced with ‘it is’; if it can’t, you don’t need the apostrophe.
- do not use in plurals, e.g. MPs.
- ‘the boy’s book’ means that the book belonged to one boy, while ‘the boys’ book’ means that the book belongs to all the boys.

### Bold
Avoid excessive use of bold. It can distract the reader and appear to ‘shout’ at them.

### Capitalisation

Our house style is to use as few capital letters as possible e.g. Cut them free campaign. Too many capital letters in a sentence distract the reader and spoil the flow of the text. Their use should largely be restricted to proper nouns (e.g. names of people and places).

Do use capitals for:

- agencies/services – e.g. Her Majesty’s Courts
- government departments – e.g. Department for Education
- political parties – e.g. the Liberal Democrats
- services – e.g. the National Health Service
- departments – e.g. Children’s Services, Marketing, and teams within departments e.g. Finance; Information Services
- job titles are only capitalised when referring to a specific person e.g. Javed Khan, Chief Executive but lower case when using more generally, e.g ‘the last two chief executives have...’

### Dates

Dates should be written in the following format: 9 January 2017

Days numbered 1-9 do not need a preceding zero and you should write the month in full. Never use suffixes after the number, e.g. ‘3rd’, ‘12th’ or ‘1st’.

Date spans in years should be written as follows: 2018-19.

Date spans in years and months should be written as follows (writing ‘to’ in full and specifying the year as few times as necessary):

9 July to 10 September 2017

### Times

Use the 12-hour clock. For example, 10am, 2.30pm. Use noon and midnight instead of 12 noon and 12 midnight.

### Hyphens

Use a hyphen to avoid ambiguity, to show that a concept is linked, or where words combine for adjectival use (e.g. high- profile case).

A hyphen can provide clarity of meaning, e.g. ‘The Barnardo’s project helps five year old children’ could have a different meaning from ‘The Barnardo’s project helps five-year-old children’ (the first could imply the project only helps five children, who are each a year old).

When a number is used before a unit of measurement, the adjective is hyphenated before the noun, e.g. a 10-year-old boy; a four-foot pole. However, the statements ‘the boy was 10 years old’ and the ‘pole was four feet long’ should not be hyphenated.

Use two words where this makes reading or understanding easier (e.g. business people).

For ease of reading, use a hyphen between two vowels (e.g. co-operative, co-ordinated, socio-economic).

Use one word when the single term is in common use and is not hard to read (e.g. ongoing).

Use a hyphen to make a new term from two separate words (e.g. African-American).

Use a hyphen to link a prefix or suffix (which cannot be a word on its own), e.g. mid-century, post-traumatic.

### Italics

Use for general emphasis in body text and always use when referring to publication titles, e.g. The Times, Barnardo’s Annual Review 2017.

### Lists and bullet points

Avoid writing sentences that contain more than four points, as they become difficult to read. Use a list with bullet points instead. Precede the bullet list with a colon. Bullets should then:

- start with a lowercase letter (except proper nouns and sub-headings)
- have no punctuation at the bullet’s end (question marks excepted)

Bullet points shouldn’t contain complete sentences or go over a number of lines (if you’re writing a sentence that goes over a number of lines, it isn’t an item in a list, so consider putting it outside the list).

### Numbers

Numbers between one and nine should be spelt out in full, but anything higher should be in digits.

If a sentence starts with a number, the figure should be written out in full, even if it is over nine; e.g. Fifty projects took part in the survey.

You should:

- always use digits for measurements, money and weights, e.g. 3km, 2kg
- hyphenate fractions, e.g. one-third,two-fifths • insert commas for numbers greater than 1,000, e.g. 10,000 (not 10000)
- abbreviate monetary values over a million
– use m for millions and bn for billions, e.g. 30m tonnes of coal. However, never use m for numbers of people – spell out in full, e.g. six million people live in London
- never use Roman numerals – subsections should be numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc., with ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, etc. being used for further division if necessary.

### Punctuation and symbols (including quotation marks)

Use single quotation marks for quoted speech, e.g. ‘Barnardo’s is my favourite charity,’ says Ben. Any quotations within a quote should be shown by double quotation marks, e.g. ‘John told me, “the answer is no”.’ Single quote marks can also be used to illustrate slang terms or reported speech.

Never put quote marks around titles, which should be in italics or capitalised.

In titles, avoid having more than one colon, e.g. instead of ‘<em>Touching Lives, Connecting People: partnership pack: response form</em>’, replace the second colon with a dash e.g. <em>Touching Lives, Connecting People: partnership pack – response form</em>.

Use one space between sentences, never two. Only use an ampersand where space is tight.

### References

All references drawn on or referred to in any Barnardo’s publication, report or materials should always be listed in full, usually in the footnotes or at the end of the chapter or document. Names of publications, reports, conferences and artistic works included in text should be in italics.

Within the text of research reports, other people’s views or works should be referred to by author surname (or organisation, if no author is named), with the year of the publication date in brackets. This is known as Harvard referencing. Try to put the reference in a position where it doesn’t affect the flow of the sentence.

For example:

- In the 1970s research revealed very little understanding of the subject among social workers (McTavish, 1998).
- McTavish (1998) showed that social workers knew little about the subject.

In text, where there are three or more authors only the first author should be listed, e.g. ‘as established by Jones et al (1998)’. Where there are two authors, both should be listed, e.g. ‘as described by Khan and Davies (2002)’.

References from websites should include the name of the person or organisation responsible for the website, and the date when the information was taken from the site. Examples of Barnardo’s preferred styles include:

- Feinstein, L (2003) Inequality in the early cognitive development of British Children in the 1970s cohort. Economica, Vol 70, pp 73-97, Wiley, London.
- Scottish Executive (1999) The Beattie Committee Report. www.scotland.gov.uk/ library2/doc04/bere_00.htm, accessed 12 January 2012.

### Referring to government departments

The first time a government department is referred to in any written material, write its name in full with the abbreviation, e.g. Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). At the start of every new chapter or section, use the full name, then use the abbreviation until the end of thesection/chapter.

### Singular and plural

A company, a government, or an organisation is singular, e.g. ‘Barnardo’s is launching a new campaign’; ‘Barclays is holding its annual conference’; ‘the Government is announcing a new policy’.

### Underline

Underline should not be used for emphasis. It should only be used to indicate links on the web or on e- communications.

### Units of measurement

It is acceptable to abbreviate units of measurement. Use kb or mb for file sizes; km for kilometres; kg for kilograms; and mph for miles per hour. Always write per cent in full (never percent), but use % in a table.

## Sensitive terms and inclusive language

Many descriptions of people or places are sensitive, politically or culturally. Our materials should not discriminate against people on the basis of ability, gender, age, race, background or any other criteria. Consider what is appropriate and try to use language that is inclusive wherever possible. Take care when referring to any personal attributes (such as age, colour or gender) and do so only if relevant.

Refer to people with respect, and as people, not collections of problems or symptoms, nor as helpless or powerless. Words such as ‘victim’ or ‘sufferer’ may not be appropriate. Terms such as ‘Christian name’ can be exclusive (use ‘first name’ instead).

### Gender

- Avoid gender stereotyping.
- Avoid gender-specific terms, e.g. use police officer rather than policeman/woman.
- Be mindful that some young people may prefer not to be referred to as he/she, instead you can use the plural(they).
- Use inclusive terms such as ‘people’ (rather than ‘men’). Do not use ‘man’ to mean all people.

### Disability

Again, be sensitive to the people concerned and seek specialist advice if necessary. In general:

- ‘disabled children and young people’ is now prefered to ‘children and young people with disabilities’.
- use ‘people-centred’ terminology e.g. blind people (not the blind).
- use deaf/hearing and speech impaired, not deaf and dumb.
- say (if relevant) that someone uses a wheelchair, not that they are ‘in a wheelchair’.
- avoid using the word ‘elderly’ – use ‘older people’
- do not use ‘handicapped’, ‘crippled’ or any other similar term
- avoid using words or phrases like ‘suffers from’, ‘struggles with’, ‘victim of’, etc.

### Ethnicity

Generally, use the term black and minority ethnic. Some people may prefer to use their family’s country or region of origin (e.g. African-Caribbean, or South Asian). Preferences and sensitivities vary, so be aware of the people you are describing and of your audience.

The terms ‘black and minority ethnic’, ‘white’, ‘mixed’ and ‘other’ should all be lower case, all the time. However, the proper nouns used to describe ethnic origin should be upper case, e.g. African, Eastern European. It is good practice to avoid the acronym BME altogether in narrative text (it can be used sparingly in tables where space is an issue).

## Geographical areas

Great Britain consists of Scotland, Wales and England. The UK is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Use these terms specifically and with care. It is not appropriate to use Ireland if you mean specifically Northern Ireland. Barnardo’s Ireland refers to Barnardo’s in the Republic of Ireland and is separate from Barnardo’s UK (which includes Northern Ireland).

## Spelling checklist

### A

**ages** when the age is stated immediately before the unit of measurement (i.e. year or month), the adjective is hyphenated before the noun, e.g. ‘the 10-year-old boy’.
